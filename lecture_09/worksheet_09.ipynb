    "To efficiently compute disagreement distances between two clustering methods on large datasets, an algorithm can be designed to leverage cluster memberships. This approach minimizes exhaustive pairwise comparisons by utilizing predefined clusters. The algorithm involves identifying points within each cluster for both clustering methods, calculating agreements where points in the same cluster in both methods are counted, and determining disagreements where points fall into different clusters. Set operations, such as intersections and differences, are used to streamline the process, enhancing efficiency and scalability. This method significantly reduces computational complexity and is adaptable to various types of data and clustering configurations."
